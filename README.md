# FIGARO
An ImageJ plugin to approximate a 3D image from a two-photon microscope with a gaussian thanks to the FIGARO algorithm.
 
The algorithm is based on the article : 
T. K. Lau, E. Chouzenoux, C. Lefort and J.-C. Pesquet 
Optimal Multivariate Gaussian Fitting for PSF Modeling in Two-Photon Microscopy. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2018), Washington DC, 4 - 7 April 2018

Please quote this article when using this plugin.
 
To use the plugin : download ImageJ or Fiji from their website, and put the FIGARO__-1.0.jar file of the plugin in the "plugin" folder of ImageJ/Fiji. The plugin will then appear in the "plugin" menu of the program. Open the image file you want to process (the image needs to be in shades of grey), and click on the "FIGARO" button. A PDF report will be automatically generated. Take note that process can take a while (from a few minutes to more than an hour depending on the computer and the image).
