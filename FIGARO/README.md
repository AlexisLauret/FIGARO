This is a Maven project implementing an ImageJ 1.x plugin.


* In [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org), for example, it is as simple as
  _File&gt;Import...&gt;Existing Maven Project_.

* In [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org), it is even simpler:
  _File&gt;Open Project_.

* The same works in [IntelliJ](http://jetbrains.net).

* If [jEdit](http://jedit.org) is your preferred IDE, you will need the
  [Maven Plugin](http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?MavenPlugin).

Die-hard command-line developers can use Maven directly by calling `mvn`
in the project root.

However you build the project, in the end you will have the `.jar` file
(called *artifact* in Maven speak) in the `target/` subdirectory. 
The right file is the file with dependencies.
